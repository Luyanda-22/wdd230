            <h2>2 Nephi 32:9</h1>

            <p>And now, my beloved brethen,I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grievethme that I must speak concerning this thing. 
                for if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.

                And it came to pass that there was not one soul, exept it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon the name of Christ.
